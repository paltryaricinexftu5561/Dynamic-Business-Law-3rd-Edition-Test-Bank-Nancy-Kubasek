  * 3 things to know about the focus of Dynamic Business Law, 3e:
  * Emphasis on ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING. In chapter 2, the authors introduce a framework for making ethical business decisions that students can use on a regular basis. Following each case there are questions designed to train students to apply this approach. Then repeatedly throughout the chapters, questions about business ethics are raised in the text. This framework is designed to help improve the learning process of students and to give a sense of relevancy to the ethical decision making process.
  * Emphasis on CRITICAL THINKING. Neil Browne, one of the co-authors of this text, has written a successful text on critical thinking. His framework is included in Dynamic Business Law as well – to help students learn how to frame and reframe a question/issue. Critical thinking questions are also included at the end of each case, to further tie in this component.
  * Emphasis on the BUSINESS in business law. Dynamic Business Law emphasizes the tie of legal issues back to the core business curriculum. This will help both students and faculty. Students need to understand how the concepts they learn in this course tie into their business careers. Instructors can easily show that the study of business law is best seen as a foundational component of the larger study of business administration.
